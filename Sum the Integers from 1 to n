% Base case: The sum of integers from 1 to 1 is 1.
sum(1, 1).

% Recursive case: Sum of integers from 1 to N is N + sum of integers from 1 to N-1.
sum(N, Total) :-
    N > 1,                % Ensure N is greater than 1
    N1 is N - 1,          % Calculate N-1
    sum(N1, PartialTotal), % Recursive call for N-1
    Total is N + PartialTotal. % Total is N plus the sum of the previous numbers

% Initialization goal
:- initialization(main).

main :-
    sum(5, Total),       % Query sum of integers from 1 to 5
    write('Total sum is: '), write(Total), nl.
